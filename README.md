# DeluxiaScripts-CSharp
This repository contains various helper methods and tools that I use to make my programs easier to make. You are welcome to use these.

## DeluxiaMethods
Various helper methods. Some highlights
* RandomizeList(): Can be used to randomize collections
* GetSum(): Adds all the numbers together in a single collection.
* AddAllInCollection(): Takes several collections and adds all the numbers in each index with each-other.
* Condense(): Takes a nested array or list or 2D array into a standard list or array.
* CloneObject(): Creates an exact clone of an object. Used to change one instance of an object without affecting the other.
* GetIndexOfElement(): This returns the first index that contains an element.
* GetWordsInSentance(): Gets all the words in a sentance, seperates by spaces.
* GetIntsInStrings(): Finds all numbers in a string and returns an int list with all of them.
## DeluxiaRandom
Works similiarly to the default C# random. This can however be used to save and return the state random is at.
## DeluxiaSerialize
Various methods to turn data into byte arrays, then turn them back to data. This is used for saving data or sending data online.
* SerializeToString(): This is very useful for debugging. This desplays a collection so it's readable by humans.
